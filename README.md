# Just Nvim
Just Nvim is just a personal nvim configuaration. It's not meant to be portable, or to appeal to anyone at all. Tested on Kali linux.

### Instalation
First, you need to install [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).
Then **just** clone this repository and move all files to your nvim config folder (e.g. ~/.config/nvim/).
There should be an error message on your first launch. Simply run `:PlugInstall`, which should install all required plugins.  
  
A possible command for this would be:  
```shell
cp -r ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/.nvim && rm -rf ~/.config/nvim && git clone https://github.com/GallowsDove/just-nvim ~/.config/nvim
```
